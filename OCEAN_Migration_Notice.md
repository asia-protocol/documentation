The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token merger, involving SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, began on July 1, 2024. As of today, SingularityNET's AGIX, Ocean Protocol's OCEAN, and Fetch.ai's FET tokens should migrate to the ASI token.

Ocean Protocol holders should swap their OCEAN tokens for the new ASI tokens using a migration contract.

## How to migrate OCEAN tokens?
For any remaining OCEAN tokens that have not yet been migrated, we have decided to conduct the migration directly using migration smart contract, rather than using a migration user interface that is no longer supported. This makes the migration process for the remaining OCEAN token holders simple.

The migration smart contract, created solely for migration purposes, allows you to migrate your OCEAN tokens without connecting to any external platforms. The migration smart contract address is open-source, meaning the code can be checked by anyone.

Using the migration contract requires users to pay the gas fee on a blockchain. The migration process is similar to any other transaction on a blockchain, and the gas fee is the same as any other transaction. We recommend choosing the average (normal) gas fee to avoid any inconvenience.

## Steps to Start Migration Process
1. Access Your Wallet: Check your OCEAN balance in the token list.

2. Send Tokens: Send your OCEAN tokens to the migration smart contract address `0x695B704DbBc467517CEc52596C0179704313F2B9`. Choose to send **the entire balance** of OCEAN tokens. The migration contract will wait for **the full balance** to arrive before initiating the migration process.

3. Confirmation: After the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration process will start, and your wallet will be credited with new ASI tokens. Depending on network usage, it may take 5–10 minutes to process the migration.

Congratulations, you have successfully performed the migration.
