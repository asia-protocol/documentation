The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token merger, involving SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, CUDOS, and Ocean Protocol, began on July 1, 2024. As of today, SingularityNET's AGIX, Ocean Protocol's OCEAN, CUDOS and Fetch.ai's FET tokens should migrate to the ASI token.

We launched the migration process without vesting via smart contracts.
