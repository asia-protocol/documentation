The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token merger, involving SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, began on July 1, 2024. As of today, SingularityNET's AGIX, Ocean Protocol's OCEAN, and Fetch.ai's FET tokens should migrate to the ASI token.

Fetch.ai holders should swap their FET tokens for the new ASI tokens using a migration contract.

> This is a 1:1 swap, which means that anyone who holds the FET token will receive the same amount of ASI tokens.

## How to migrate FET tokens?
For any remaining FET tokens that have not yet been migrated, we have decided to conduct the migration directly using migration smart contract, rather than using a migration user interface that is no longer supported. This makes the migration process for the remaining FET token holders simple.

The migration smart contract, created solely for migration purposes, allows you to migrate your FET tokens without connecting to any external platforms. The migration smart contract address is open-source, meaning the code can be checked by anyone.

Using the migration contract requires users to pay the gas fee on a blockchain. The migration process is similar to any other transaction on a blockchain, and the gas fee is the same as any other transaction. We recommend choosing the average (normal) gas fee to avoid any inconvenience.

## Steps to Start Migration Process
1. Access Your Wallet: Check your FET balance in the token list.

2. Send Tokens: Send your FET tokens to the migration smart contract address `0x695B704DbBc467517CEc52596C0179704313F2B9`. Choose to send **the entire balance** of FET tokens. The migration contract will wait for **the full balance** to arrive before initiating the migration process.

3. Confirmation: After the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration process will start, and your wallet will be credited with new ASI tokens. Depending on network usage, it may take 5â€“10 minutes to process the migration.

Congratulations, you have successfully performed the migration.
